# :sparkles: Welcome :sparkles:
Welcome and thank you for your interest in the HeliOS Project. The HeliOS Project is a community delivered, open source project to build and maintain the HeliOS embedded operating system (OS). HeliOS is a full-featured OS that is designed to meet the needs of a broad user community of enthusiasts, researchers, STEM educators and academics. HeliOS is also designed to meet the needs of users of every skill level from the electronics hobbyist implementing an OS in his or her Arduino project to a research scientist developing a remote sensing instrument that will be deployed to the field. Regardless of what you do or how how long youâ€™ve been doing it, you can start building your embedded application on top of HeliOS right now. To get started, visit the [HeliOS repositry](https://github.com/heliosproj/HeliOS) and check out the section on **:dart: Getting Started**. If you have questions or are in need of support, open a new issue in GitHub.
