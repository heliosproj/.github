# Welcome
The HeliOS Project is a community based, open source, project to build and maintain the HeliOS embedded operating system. HeliOS is a full-featured OS that is designed to meet the needs of a broad user community of enthusiasts, researchers, STEM educators and academics. HeliOS is also designed to meet the needs of users of every skill level from the electronics hobbyist implementing an OS in her/her Arduino project to a research scientist developing a remote sensing instrument that will be deployed to the field. Regardless of what you do or how many years youâ€™ve been doing it, you can start building your embedded application on top of HeliOS in a few minutes. To start building on top of HeliOS, visit the [HeliOS repositry](https://github.com/heliosproj/HeliOS) and check out the section on Getting Started.
