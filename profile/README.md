# About
The HeliOS Project is an open source, community delivered, embedded operating system project. The goal of the Project is to deliver a modern, full featured, embedded operating system that meets the needs of academia, research, STEM education and enthusiasts alike. This requires one embedded operating system to meet the needs of a broad range of users from the entry level Arduino user implementing an embedded operating system in his/her project for the first time to a researcher developing a remote sensing instrument that will be deployed to take measurements of its environment. Regardless of your use case, HeliOS is easily integrated into any embedded development environment.
