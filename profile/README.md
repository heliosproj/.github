# About
The HeliOS Project is an open source, community based, project to build and maintain a full-featured embedded operating system that meets the needs of academia, research, STEM education and enthusiasts alike. The HeliOS Project community represents a wide range of users and contributors from the electronics hobbyist implementing an embedded operating system in his/her Arduino project to a research scientist developing a remote sensing instrument that will be deployed to the field. Whether you wish to be a user or contributor, you are a part of the HeliOS Project community and for that we say welcome!
